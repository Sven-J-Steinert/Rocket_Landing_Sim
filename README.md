# Rocket Landing Simulator
Time step based physical simulation in python.

```
a = acceleration
v = velocity
x = location
```

core computation by integrating a over dt for v and integrating v over dt for x

currently supported parameters

* gravitaional acceleration
* rocket engine acceleration
* rocket engine direction
